The flow of the app is as follows:
- On startup, Work Timer is enabled by default
- On startup, the "Work Time" and "Break Time" text fields are each set to 5 minutes and 0 seconds.
- The Reset button wil set the running timer back to the values in the "Work Time" or "Break Time"
text fields (depending on which timer is running).
- Hitting the Reset button will stop the timer from running after reset.
- Changing values in the text fields will cause a real-time update in the running timer, 
which does not stop running.
- If changing the text input value for the non-running timer, the currently running timer is not affected.
- Erasing values in the text fields will set them to 0.
